# hello-world


Hey!
I am collins, I just started my journey into the amazing Tech-World!, I am presently learning Html,Css and Javascript(along side jQuery).based on my experience so far ,i think i am going to do well, although programming can be annoying and frustrating at times but i understood that difficulty goes along with it(coding).
